			<h2>About the Author</h2>
			<p>Robert Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh, in Scotland, in 1850. His father was an engineer, and in 1867 Robert went to Edinburgh University to study engineering himself. He found that engineering did not interested him and trained to be a lawyer instead, but in fact he had already decided to be a writer. He met his feature wife, Fanny Osbourne, in France. She was American, and a married woman with two children. They fell in love, and after Fanny’s divorce, she and Stevenson were married in 1880, in San Francisco in the USA.</p>

			<p>Stevenson liked to travel, although much of the time his health was poor. In 1888, he and Fanny went to live on the pacific island of Samoa because the weather there was good for Stevenson’s health. The islanders called him ‘The Teller of Tales’. He died on Samoa in 1894.</p>

			<p>Stevenson wrote travel books, short stories, and novels. His most famous titles include <em>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</em> (1886) and his exciting adventure stories, such as <em>Treasure Island</em> (1883) and <em>Kidnapped</em> (1886), which have been popular since they first appeared. Stevenson began to write Treasure Island to amuse Fanny’s young son, Lloyd, during a rainy holiday in Scotland, and he read it aloud to his family each evening. The story of Jim hearing about the mutiny while inside an apple barrel was an experience that had actually happened to Stevenson’s father when he himself was a boy. And Long John Silver, that famous one-legged pirate with a parrot on his shoulder, was based on the character of one of Stevenson’s friends.</p>
